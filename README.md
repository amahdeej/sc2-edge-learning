# Knowledge Distillation For Wireless Edge Learning
This repository contains the code for frame error prediction in an wireless edge learning framework. The node based dataset for 

Spectrum Challange 2 Dataset and Frame Error Prediction Code
Deep Learning for Frame Error Prediction using a DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) Dataset.

# Code
SC2-Nodes-Edge-Learning.ipynb contains the experiments. Analyze-Results.ipynb uses the results saved by the experiments to generate the plots and statistics. The paper contains more details.

# Dataset

The dataset is approved for public release, distribution unlimited at https://github.com/amahdeej/sc2-frame-error.
